# SubtleSense
A straightforward tool to fix out-of-sync subtitle files.

## How to use
1. Specify subtitle file:

   Input the file location of the subtitle file manually or use the "Browse" button to navigate and select the file.
   
2. Specify time shift:

   Specify how much time, in seconds, by which to hasten or delay the subtitle.
   * In case of hastening, enter a negative value.
   * Additionally, you can also use SS.MMM format to adjust timestamps in seconds and milliseconds.

3. Process subtitle:

   Click the "Process subtitle" button to initiate the adjustment process.

4. Save file:

   Override the original file to start using it right away, or save the file to a different location or with a different name, if you wish to.

## Why use SubtleSense, when VLC Media Player has built-in track synchronization?
VLC's track synchronization is temporary and resets once the video is closed. You have to synchronize the subtitle again if you want to re-watch the video.

With SubtleSense, timestamps in the subtitle file are adjusted permanently, so there is no need to re-synchronize the subtitle with the video if you ever wish to re-watch it.
